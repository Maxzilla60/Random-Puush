# Random Puush
Opens a (or multiple) random public [Puush.me](http://puush.me) links!
Just because...

## What?
[**See it in action online**](https://random-puush.herokuapp.com)!

This script generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images and opens them in the browser

## How?
* Get yourself [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the script (the script can be run with an argument for multiple links to be found, defaults to 1)
* Wait a (long) while...
* Check out the randomness!

## Run
`rand_puush.py` (opens 1 link)

`rand_puush.py 5` (opens 5 links)

## Man, this script is slow
I know. :(

Don't really know how to optimize it.
