# Random Puush (Script Version)
Opens a (or multiple) random public [Puush.me](http://puush.me) screenshots!
Just because...

## What?
This script generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images and opens them in the browser

## How?
* Get yourself [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Run the script (see **"Running the Python Script"**)
* Wait a (long) while...
* Check out the randomness!

**OR**

* [Check it out online](https://github.com/Maxzilla60/Random-Puush/tree/flask-website)!

## Running the Python Script
`rand_puush.py` (opens 1 link)

`rand_puush.py 5` (opens 5 links, one thread per link)

`rand_puush.py -1` (runs the script in endless mode, opening links as it finds them)

### Man, this script is slow
I know. :(

Don't really know how to optimize it.
