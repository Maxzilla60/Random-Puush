# Random Puush
[Flask](https://flask.pocoo.org) Version, hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

This site shows a random [Puush.me](http://puush.me) screenshot!
Just because...

## Where?
### **[Right here!](https://random-puush.herokuapp.com)**

## What?
An AJAX call to a Python script that generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images.

### It's loading forever
I know it can load long. No idea how to optimize it. :(

### The image is broken
Click it! It might actually (for some reason) be some text instead of an image!
