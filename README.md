# Random Puush (Flask Version)
This site shows a random [Puush.me](http://puush.me) link!
Just because...

## What?
An AJAX call to a Python script that generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images.

## How?
* Get yourself [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Get yourself [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* Open commandprompt and run the script: `python rand_puush_flask.py`
* Go to the given IP address in a brwoser
* Wait a (long) while...
* Check out the randomness!

## Man, this is slow
I know. :(

Don't really know how to optimize it.
