# Random Puush
Opens a (or multiple) random public [Puush.me](http://puush.me) screenshots!
Just because...

## What?
This script generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images and then automatically opens them in the browser

## How?
* Get yourself [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Run the script (see **"Running the Python Script"**)
* Wait a (long) while...
* Check out the randomness!

## Running the Python Script
`rand_puush.py` (opens 1 link)

`rand_puush.py 5` (opens 5 links)

`rand_puush.py 5 4` (opens 5 links, using 4 threads)

`rand_puush.py -1` (runs the script in endless mode, opening links as it finds them)

`rand_puush.py -1 4` (runs the script in endless mode, using 4 threads)

## I don't want the script to open the links automatically!
Do not fret, there is a Simple Output version which you can find on [this branch](https://github.com/Maxzilla60/Random-Puush/tree/simple-output-script). This version just prints out the links to the console.
