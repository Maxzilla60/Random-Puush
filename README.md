# Random Puush
Opens a (or multiple) random public [Puush.me](http://puush.me) links!
Just because...

## What?
This script generates random Puush URLs and checks if they are viewable/public images and opens them in the browser

## How?
* Get yourself [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Open the script (the script can be run with an argument for multiple links to be found, defaults to 1)
* Wait a (long) while...
* Check out the randomness!

## Run
`rand_puush.py` (opens 1 link)
`rand_puush.py 5` (opens 5 links)
